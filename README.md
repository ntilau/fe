# Finite Element Software a.k.a. FES
Code developed during my Ph.D., based on Armadillo NICTA, GetFEM Gmm++, METIS, MUMPS, TETGEN, ARPACK, OpenBlas, LAPACK and VTK postprocessing done with ParaView

Validations of the implementation was done through HFSS mesh extraction and results comparisons, opening the door to the investigation of nonlinear and domain decomposition formulations
